# ComputerChess

Authors: Jack Lindsey and Jack Abeel

A computer chess program.  The difficulty can be adjusted by setting the time the computer takes for each move.
Uses standard techniques for chess AIs (e.g. minimax algorithm, piece-square tables, etc.) and has been (hopefully!)
optimized somewhat by a genetic algorithm simulation ("ChessLearning").

Note: Ctrl + Shift + click to undo a move
